# L1120 iPaaS hackathon

Welcome to this hackathon. Putting integration solution together used to take days and you will have to have some sort of coding background to successfully putting data from various service together. Today, you will be using Red Hatâ€™s low code iPaaS platform, using the minimum code to achieve maximum integration result! 

First of all, give us 15 mins to walk through the tooling platform with you,  so you know where everything is. After that we will let you work on two instructor lead integration scenarios, to get you familiar with the environment, and platform. Then you are free to hack it away!
